⚪Diverse Event Services: Showcase a wide range of event services tailored to social events and community/cultural events. Include options for weddings, birthday parties, anniversaries, and more. Highlight the variety of event types your website can cater to.

⚪User-Friendly Navigation: Implement an intuitive navigation system with a responsive navbar, making it easy for users to explore your website. Use active routes to provide clear feedback on the current page, ensuring a seamless user experience.

⚪Detailed Event Service Information: Each event service listed on your website should provide comprehensive information, including event descriptions, pricing, images, and short descriptions. Users should be able to access detailed service information by clicking on service-specific buttons.

⚪Secure Authentication: Ensure user data security by implementing email and password-based authentication with Firebase. Allow users to register and log in, and provide error messages for password complexity and email matching. Implement an additional login option, such as Google or Facebook, for added convenience.

⚪Personalized User Experience: Once users are logged in, personalize their experience by displaying their name, profile picture, and a logout button in the header. This personalization creates a sense of belonging and encourages user engagement.
